# Perceptual Loss for Image Editing 🎨🖼️🔧

This code implements a method for image editing based on perceptual loss. It is designed to work with pre-trained GANs, and offers three modes: project, draw, and interpolate.

## Features 🌟
- Perceptual loss implementation with support for masked and unmasked targets
- Three editing modes: project, draw, and interpolate
- Easy integration with pre-trained GANs
- Compatible with various latents ('z', 'w', 'w+')
- Integration with [Wandb](https://wandb.ai) for logging and visualization

## Usage 🚀

To use this code, first import the required packages, then provide the necessary input arguments, and finally choose the editing mode you want to use. The main functions are `project()`, `draw()`, and `interpolate()`.

### Importing Packages 📦

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Perceptual Loss Code 🚀

This is a PyTorch implementation of Perceptual Loss for image generation tasks. The code allows you to project images into the latent space, draw new images based on a sketch, and interpolate between images. The implementation is based on StyleGAN2.

## Features 🌟
* Project images into latent space (z, w, w+)
* Draw new images based on sketches (with masks)
* Interpolate between images
* Uses Perceptual Loss and L1 Loss for optimization
* Optional regularization term during optimization

## Usage 🛠️

### Project
To project an image into the latent space, use the `project` function.

### Draw
To draw a new image based on a sketch, use the `draw` function.

### Interpolate
To interpolate between two images, use the `interpolate` function.

## Dependencies 📚
* PyTorch
* torchvision
* wandb
